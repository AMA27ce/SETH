SETH - SNP Extraction Tool for Human Variations

SETH is a text mining software for extracting mentions of single nucleotide polymorphism written 
in the latest nomenclature of the Human Genome Variation Society for the description of sequence variants. 
It uses Scala parser combinators to specify a recently published EBNF for this nomenclature [1].


Current Components:
/src/main/scala/seth/ner/SETHNER - Named Entity Recognition

Under Development:
Normalization to dbSNP entries

Using SETH's mutation NER component in your code:
    import seth.ner.SETHNER
    val extractor = new SETHNER
    val sentence = "some text containing mutation mentions"
    val mutations = extractor.extractMutations(sentence)
    for (mutation <- mutations) 
      println(
        mutation.text, 
        mutation.start,
        mutation.end,
        mutation.typ, 
        mutation.ref, 
        mutation.loc, 
        mutation.wild, 
        mutation.mutated
      )
